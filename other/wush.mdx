## What is Wush?

Wush is a command line tool that lets you transfer files and open shells over a peer-to-peer WireGuard connection. It's similar to magic-wormhole, but:

1. No need to set up or trust a relay server for authentication.
2. Powered by WireGuard for secure, fast, and reliable connections.
3. Automatic peer-to-peer connections over UDP.
4. Endless possibilities with `rsync`, `ssh`, and more.

## Commands

**Usage:**

`wush <subcommand>`

Start the wush server:

```bash
wush serve
```

Open a shell to the wush host:

```bash
wush ssh
```

Transfer files to the wush host using `rsync`:

```bash
wush rsync local-file.txt :/path/to/remote/file
```

Copy a single file to the host:

```bash
wush cp local-file.txt
```

**Subcommands:**

| Command | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `cp` | Transfer files. |
| `port-forward` | Forward ports. |
| `rsync` | Transfer files over `rsync`. |
| `serve` | Run the wush server. |
| `ssh` | Open a shell. |
| `version` | Show wush version. |

**Options:**

```bash
wush --version
```

Print the version and exit.

## Install

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/coder/wush/releases/tag/v0.3.0).

We tested the program using machines running *Windows* and *Linux* (with a GUI).

For *Windows*, extract files to a folder and drive of your choice. Transferred files will be sent to/from there.

On *Linux*, install it using your preferred method. Files (for us) were saved/sent to/from the home directory.

## How to use

Now let's transfer a PNG file from one machine to another. In this example, Windows acts as the host and Linux is the client.

<Warning>
Treat the auth key as a secret. Share it only with the intended recipient and rotate by starting a new session.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Start the host session">
Open **CMD** from the folder where **Wush** is located, then run:

```bash
./wush serve
```

![wushserve](/images/wush/wushserve.png)

Copy the `Auth key`.
</Step>

<Step title="Send a file from the client">
On the client machine, run:

```bash
wush cp 2.png
```

![wushcp](/images/wush/wushcp.png)

`2.png` is the file we want to send from Linux to Windows.
</Step>

<Step title="Paste the auth key and confirm transfer">
Paste the key from the host machine into the client console.
</Step>
</Steps>

How it looks:

## SSH

You can also use Wush for remote access to a machine's console.

The connection is established with an auth key.

For host:

```bash
wush serve
```

For client:

```bash
wush ssh
```
