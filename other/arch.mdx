## Preparation of installation image

<Note>
    Linux systems can be installed almost anywhere: on a desktop, laptop, USB drive, or even a phone (if the distribution supports it). The installation process is roughly the same, but some differences matter. For example, when installing Arch Linux as a second system, you may need to manually configure `efibootmgr`. Dual boot setup also differs between BIOS and UEFI.
</Note>

What you need:

- A USB flash drive
- The system ISO file
- A program to write the ISO image
- A machine where Arch will be installed

This guide assumes Arch will be the primary operating system.

First, download the system image from the official Arch Linux website using your preferred method. We recommend using a torrent client.

You can write the image with tools like:

- Rufus
- Balena Etcher
- UltraISO

In this example, we use Rufus. After downloading the image, open Rufus and configure:

- Device: Select your **USB flash drive**.
- Boot selection: Choose **Disk or ISO image** and select the Arch Linux ISO path.
- Partition scheme: Select **MBR**.
- File system: Select **FAT32**.
- Cluster size: Leave as **default**.

<Danger>
    All files on the USB drive will be erased.
</Danger>

Click **Start**. In the pop-up window, select the option that mentions **ISO**.

After the process is complete, connect the USB flash drive to the target machine.
Enter BIOS and disable Secure Boot (you can enable it again after installation).
Boot from USB, choose **Arch Linux install medium**, and wait for the system to load.

## Installation

### Setting up a wireless network

If you are connected via wired Ethernet, test connectivity:

```bash
ping archlinux.org
```

If you get a response, networking works. If not, required services may not have started. Try restarting or re-creating the installer image.

For Wi-Fi, use `iwctl`:

```bash
iwctl
```

![iwctl](/images/archlinux/iwctl_settings.png)

Then run:

1. List available wireless devices:

```bash
device list
```

Identify your wireless interface (for example, `wlan0`).

2. Scan for networks:

```bash
station wlan0 scan
```

3. Show available networks:

```bash
station wlan0 get-networks
```

4. Connect to a network:

```bash
station wlan0 connect {network}
```

Enter the password if prompted.

5. Check status:

```bash
station wlan0 show
```

Then confirm connectivity:

```bash
ping archlinux.org
```

### Disk partitioning

Two common partitioning utilities are:

- `fdisk`
- `cfdisk`

This guide uses `fdisk`.

First, identify your disk.

<Danger>
    Disconnect unnecessary disks to reduce risk of selecting the wrong disk.
</Danger>

List disks:

```bash
fdisk -l
```

Configure your target disk (example):

```bash
fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
```

Create three partitions:

| Partition | Size | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `boot` | `1G` | EFI system |
| `swap` | `8G` | Linux swap |
| `root` | Remaining space | Linux filesystem |

Press `p` to list current partitions.

Press `n` to create a new partition. Keep default partition number and first sector, then set last sector to `+1G` for `boot`.

Repeat for `swap` (for example `+4G` to `+8G`) and use the remaining space for `root`.

<Danger>
    SWAP is recommended if your machine has less than 8 GB of RAM.
</Danger>

After creating partitions, press `w` to write changes.

### Archinstall

Now run:

```bash
archinstall
```

You should see the installer menu.

![archinstall](/images/archlinux/archinstall.png)

Suggested settings:

**Locale**

Select your preferred locale (for example `en_US` or `ru_RU`).

<Note>
    Press `?` to search quickly.
</Note>

**Disk configuration**

- Select `Manual Partitioning`.
- Select your disk (for example `nvme0n1`).
- For the 1G partition: assign mountpoint `/boot`, mark for format, set filesystem to `fat32`.
- For the root partition: assign mountpoint `/`, mark for format, set filesystem to `ext4`.
- Select `Confirm and exit`.

**Bootloader**

- Select `GRUB`.

**Hostname**

Enter your system name (you can keep `archlinux`).

**Root password**

Set and confirm a root password.

**User account**

- Add username and password.
- Confirm superuser privileges (`sudo`) with `Yes`.

**Profile**

- Select `Type`.
- Select `Desktop`.
- Choose `KDE Plasma`.
- Choose `sddm`.

You can keep graphics driver as default (`All`) unless you need a specific one.

**Network configuration**

- Choose `Use NetworkManager`.

**Additional packages**

Add useful tools, for example:

`nano firefox btop`

**Timezone**

Choose your timezone.

<Note>
    Press `?` to search quickly.
</Note>

**Audio**

Select `pipewire`.

**Install**

- Select `Install`.
- Confirm `Yes` and wait.
- When asked to continue setup in `chroot`, select `Yes`.

### GRUB configuration

Check if Arch boot entry exists:

```bash
efibootmgr
```

Install GRUB to EFI:

```bash
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --recheck
```

If successful, you should see `Installation finished. No errors reported`.

Re-check boot entries:

```bash
efibootmgr
```

Reboot:

```bash
reboot
```

## Dual-boot

If you need to add a Windows boot entry, become root first:

```bash
sudo su
```

Install `os-prober`:

```bash
pacman -S os-prober
```

Edit GRUB defaults:

```bash
nano /etc/default/grub
```

Uncomment or set:

```bash title="/etc/default/grub"
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=y
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

Check for Windows Boot Manager:

```bash
os-prober
```

Generate GRUB config:

```bash
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

If there are no errors, reboot:

```bash
reboot
```
