## Periodic phone wipe notes

It is good practice to wipe your device every N-period. I recommend wiping iPhone on every major release (iOS 17 -> 18). Why? Because it is iOS.

This page was written because I migrated from iPhone 12 (64GB) to Nothing Phone (2).

## Backup

<Warning>
Resetting your iPhone erases local data. Confirm your backup before you start.
</Warning>

- Manually upload all files to Nextcloud if iCloud storage is full.
- Reset your phone and set it up fresh, not by using a backup. However, if it only contains your personal files, then you may. I still prefer doing everything manually.
- You can't downgrade if your iOS is NOT jailbroken.
