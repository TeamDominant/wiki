description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

Welcome to TeamDominant/wiki — a growing collection of practical answers, step-by-step guides, and distilled instructions for a wide range of software tools and technologies.

This wiki is built from real-world experience: everything my team, friends, and I have encountered, struggled with, or mastered throughout our work and personal lives. It’s a place to capture those hard-earned lessons so they don’t get lost — and to save others the time we’ve already spent figuring things out.

## What to Expect

- Concise and practical documentation
- Focus on **clarity over completeness**
- Topics based on real needs, not theoretical coverage
- Occasional opinions — always grounded in experience

## Language Support

Currently, all content is in a single language. **Multilingual support is planned**, so stay tuned if you're waiting for translations.

Our philosophy is simple: understanding takes effort. This wiki doesn't aim to spoon-feed, but to guide. You’re encouraged to dive into topics, explore the details, and build real comprehension.

## Using This Wiki

We'll be adding screenshots and visual examples soon to show:

- How to navigate the sidebar
- How to use the search bar effectively
- How to quickly jump to relevant topics

Until then, feel free to explore — and don't hesitate to jump between sections. This documentation is meant to evolve as we do.
