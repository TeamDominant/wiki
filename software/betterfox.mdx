## Required reading

1. Create a [backup profile](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Backup).
2. Download `user.js` from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/main/user.js) (right click and select `Save Link As…`).
3. Review [Common Overrides](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Common-Overrides) and [Optional Hardening](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Optional-Hardening), then apply the required changes.
4. Open Firefox.
5. In the URL bar, enter `about:profiles` and press **Enter**.
6. For the profile to use, click **Open Folder** in **Root Directory**.
7. Move `user.js` into that folder.

After restarting Firefox:

1. Install an ad blocker such as [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/ublock-origin-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ad-blocker/) and apply the [recommended filters](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists#guidelines).
2. Enable DNS-level protection with a preferred [provider](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Optional-Hardening#secure-dns) to improve protection against threats, ads, and trackers.

## Simple goals

1. **Minimalism:** remove features that are not needed.
2. **Efficiency:** improve Firefox speed and performance.
3. **Privacy:** protect data without breaking websites.

## Simple configs
