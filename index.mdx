Welcome to TeamDominant/wiki, a growing collection of practical answers, step-by-step guides, and distilled instructions for software tools and technologies.

This wiki is built from real-world experience. It captures what our team, friends, and collaborators encountered, solved, and refined over time, so hard-earned lessons stay accessible.

<Note>
  This documentation prioritizes practical outcomes. It is opinionated where
  needed, and those opinions come from direct usage.

## What to expect

- Concise and practical documentation.
- Focus on **clarity over completeness**.
- Topics based on real needs, not theoretical coverage.
- Occasional opinions grounded in experience.

## Language support

Content is currently available in one language. Multilingual support is planned.

The documentation does not aim to spoon-feed. The goal is to guide, encourage exploration, and help build real understanding.

This wiki will continue evolving with the tools, workflows, and problems we face.
